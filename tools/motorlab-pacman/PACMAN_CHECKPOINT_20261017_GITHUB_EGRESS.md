# Pac-Man LAB — GitHub egress recovery, 17 October 2026

Status: source fix verified locally; protected staging rollout and live readiness pending.
Session release pin: `2026.10.14-r37`. R38 continuity rules remain applicable as recorded by the canonical CORE; this is not an r38 release promotion.

## Identity and verified baseline

- Repository: `Br174/Chatgpt`.
- LAB branch: `motorlab/pacman-execution-v2-lab-20261014`.
- Parent HEAD: `fbd1359823722061b2f96a989a785a9485c5c9b5`.
- Owner cycle operation ID: `pacman-webauthn-lab-20261017-ff59959a-01`.
- Exact allowed probe: `tools/motorlab-pacman/probe-webauthn-cycle-20261017.txt`.
- No project hook or `.motorlab/` satellite was found in the complete, non-truncated LAB tree. No satellite was invented or created during this repair.

## Actual remote evidence

Read-only audit: https://github.com/Br174/Chatgpt/actions/runs/39053150909

The workflow completed successfully as a diagnostic, not as proof of readiness:

- `PACMAN_POSTPARITY_GITHUB_ACTIONS_PROBE_ABSENT`.
- Category `EXECUTION_GITHUB_EGRESS_READ_FAILURE`.
- Schema verified `true`; readiness HTTP `503`, error `STAGING_GITHUB_READ_UNAVAILABLE`.
- WebAuthn authenticated and public GitHub diagnostics both HTTP `200`.
- No deploy, GitHub create/delete, or D1 mutation occurred in that audit.

Previous signing workflow: https://github.com/Br174/Chatgpt/actions/runs/39037378193

Its private HMAC proof and independent gate activation succeeded. The later GitHub readiness check failed. Do not repeat enrollment, bootstrap, or initial gate activation.

## Root-cause hypothesis and verification

The existing Execution Contents adapter omitted `User-Agent`; the working WebAuthn GitHub path includes it. GitHub requires a valid explicit application User-Agent:
https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/troubleshooting-the-rest-api#user-agent-required

Two new regression tests first failed with `GITHUB_READ_FAILED_403` and readiness `503`, respectively. Adding `User-Agent: motorlab-pacman-execution` made both pass. This proves the source defect against GitHub's request contract; actual Worker recovery still requires a successful staging readback.

- Clean baseline: 726 tests passed, 0 failed.
- Final local suite: 739 tests passed, 0 failed, including 11 workflow refresh tests.
- YAML parsed; GitHub `contents: read`, protected environment, branch constraints, manual redirect handling, and `--keep-vars` preserved.

## Change Compatibility Guard — existing owners reused

| Responsibility | Previous behavior | Current behavior | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Existing Contents adapter | No explicit application User-Agent | Adds only the required header to the same fixed-host, fixed-branch, fixed-path requests | Complementary extension |
| Canonical issuer-parity rollout | Any pre-existing parity marker required a separate manual audit | Exact secret marker plus verified live schema and fresh private HMAC allow Execution-only refresh | Narrow supersession after the completed audit |
| First activation | Gate absent; deploy both Workers, prove HMAC, enable gate | Same initial sequence retained | Independent protected path |
| Refresh after proven parity | No supported refresh path | Skip WebAuthn deployment and gate rewriting; preserve secrets and reverify after Execution deploy | Same rollout owner, no second writer |
| Historical Execution deployment/refresh workflows | Manual-only or disabled push triggers | Unchanged | Preserved, not reactivated |

Negative tests block wrong HMAC, public transport, duplicate/non-secret marker, relocked runtime, consumed approval, changed HEAD, and an existing probe. None of these cases emits permission to deploy.

## Resume sequence

1. Recheck current LAB HEAD before any source ref update; reconcile concurrent changes.
2. Use the existing canonical workflow `.github/workflows/pacman-issuer-parity-staging-lab.yml` at this repair commit. Its validation must pass before the protected job.
3. If GitHub requests environment review, the owner approves only `pacman-execution-staging` for the exact repair run. This is a provider action, not a repeated chat authorization.
4. Verify fresh predeploy HMAC, Execution-only deploy, postdeploy HMAC, exact D1 schema, and `STAGING_CYCLE_READY_FOR_OWNER_PASSKEY`.
5. Only after readiness is proven, request the separate fresh owner biometric for the existing exact LAB cycle. Never perform the real probe create/read/delete/read cycle before that biometric.
6. Preserve checkpoint/claim integrity; do not retry an uncertain mutation blindly.

## Scope and progress

No main, MADRE, production, D1 schema, Cloudflare Access, new token, paid service, or permission expansion is authorized. Existing protected staging deploys and necessary LAB repairs remain within the approved scope. Do not approve old run `39037125095`.

Carry forward Pac-Man global `98%` and WebAuthn `99%`, both delta `0%`, until new operational evidence justifies an update. Root Cause Closure and end-to-end acceptance remain pending; local green tests are not global completion.
