# MotorLab / Pac-Man Execution V2 — Real Operations LAB Phase 1

Date: 2026-10-17
Repository: Br174/Chatgpt
LAB branch: motorlab/pacman-real-operations-lab-20261017
Main baseline: 8615e8321bf9896f28826a09aa0c9f61ce5ecbb7
Scope: this LAB branch only; no main, MADRE, historical LAB, production Worker or D1 modifications.

## Implemented on LAB
- Reuse existing Pac-Man chat coordinator as single coordinator, with a separate executeControlledUpdate method guarded by a host-injected approval verifier and durable atomic ledger.
- Reuse the existing GitHub Contents adapter module; add scoped controlled GET and SHA-conditional PUT for lab-workspace/*.md|txt|json.
- Add controlled file update operation with operationId, target branch/path, expected blob SHA, content SHA-256, approved intent, atomic claim, pre-write checkpoint, readback and durable receipt.
- Failed or ambiguous PUT -> RECOVERY_REQUIRED; no automatic retry; failed prewrite checkpoint -> no PUT.
- Keep the historical github.lab-file-cycle branch and path behavior unchanged.
- Add 16 dedicated Node unit tests and a branch-only, read-only GitHub Actions workflow. No deployment, secrets or remote side effects in the workflow.

## Verified direct provider actions (GitHub connector)
- Created isolated LAB sample file.
- Updated the existing SAMPLE.md using the exact prior blob SHA.
- Independent GET readback matched the requested updated content.
- Commit: e77deb36a9027381752c48aaf0f1e33112503136.
- Negative test: replay of outdated blob SHA rejected with GitHub HTTP 409; file SHA/content unchanged.
- Compare main...LAB: main not moved; only explicitly scoped six files differed before this checkpoint file.
- No GitHub Actions success is asserted from combined status (no check runs returned by the available read path).

## Local source evaluation
- 15/15 source-level behavior tests passed in isolated V8 with synthetic Web API shims.
- 2/2 existing chat-coordinator integration tests passed in the same simulation.
- The tests used exact GitHub-fetched source strings, not a live Worker or authenticated ChatGPT MCP.
- GitHub Actions Node 22 workflow is committed but its live result remains NOT_VERIFIED via current tool access.
- The historical 765/765 main integration gate is baseline evidence, NOT a freshly rerun outcome for this branch.

## Next authoritative gates
1. Obtain GitHub Actions Node 22 run/result for the new branch and fix any failures solely on this LAB.
2. Execute an independently verified approval flow with the new capability, using a genuine host-issued signed approval; do not treat mock verifier / chat text as cryptographic authorization.
3. Test a complete practical file update through the deployed staging path only after separate deployment authorization.
4. Later expand to PR lifecycle and Cloudflare staging deployment through separate narrowly authorized review.
5. On recovery use this checkpoint and do not repeat the completed 2026-10-17 historical WebAuthn file-cycle.

State: CODE_COMMITTED; CONTROLLED_GITHUB_CONNECTOR_WRITE_VERIFIED; SIMULATED_SAFETY_TESTS_17_OF_17; NODE_CI_UNVERIFIED; WORKER_NEW_CAPABILITY_NOT_DEPLOYED.
